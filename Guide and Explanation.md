# task_management_web_app
This is a task management where you can allow to view, add, mark as complete your task.

<!-- Guide -->

Database name = task_management <br>
Database table name = task_data <br><br>

<!--Explanation -->

In overall features of this web application, I create web app that can store data in mySQL database, also it has a features that it can read or view the data from mySQL database in phpmyAdmin. <br>
I use a data table bootstrap to have an efficient table which has a jquery function, I also editted some design of the bootstrap for my data table. <br>

A side from that it has a features that it can add, update, view and delete data from database.
There is feature that I put here is when the user marked as complete a task in the table, and then it will show an alert message that your task are completed, and if he did it again even if the task is already completed, it will show an alert message again that the task was already completed. It it also appear in the table if the task is not completed or completed already. <br>

I also put here a syntax for the export of data from database which it converted to xls file in excel.
Another of that, I create a pop-up function in add features, to less the creation of file from my folder. But the other features like delete, view and update file, I use a trick that it looks like an pop-up features but I use a href tag and copy some syntax from the index file to look all of them are in one page.
